# Cat Bot

Cat Bot posts cat and dog images on demand in Discord. [Invite them to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=290905108320092170&scope=bot) and run `catbot help` in a channel to see what they can do.

Uses the [Heleus](https://github.com/nerdcubed/Heleus) Discord bot framework for [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/).
